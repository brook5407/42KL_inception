        <h2>How Docker and docker-compose work</h2>
        <p>
          Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running
          applications using containers. Containers allow developers to package
          up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries
          and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. Docker
          makes it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by providing
          a consistent environment that can be used across different machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Docker-compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container
          Docker applications. It allows developers to define all of the
          services that make up an application in a YAML file, and then start
          them all up with a single command. Docker-compose simplifies the
          process of managing complex multi-container applications by providing
          a simple way to define and manage them.

        <h2>
          The difference between a Docker image used with docker-compose and
          without docker-compose
        </h2>
        <p>
          A Docker image is a pre-configured package that contains all the
          files, libraries, and dependencies required to run a specific
          application. When running a Docker image without docker-compose, you
          would need to manually configure each container and its dependencies.
          Docker-compose allows developers to define all the services that make
          up an application in a single YAML file, making it easier to manage
          and deploy multiple containers.

        <h2>The benefits of Docker compared to VMs</h2>
        <p>
          Docker has several benefits over traditional virtual machines (VMs).
          First, Docker containers are more lightweight and consume fewer
          resources than VMs, which makes them faster and more efficient.
          Second, Docker containers can be easily moved between different
          machines or environments, making it easier to deploy and scale
          applications. Third, Docker provides a consistent environment across
          different machines, which helps to reduce the risk of dependency
          issues or other problems that can arise when running applications on
          different systems.
